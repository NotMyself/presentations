# WTH is a JWT

Chances are sooner or later your shiny new single page application will need authentication.  Add some security and resource access control to that list as well.  But how can we integrate all of this into  a single page application that is entirely public?  How can we ensure that our users only have access to the resources they are authorized to by hacking way in via the console?  In this talk, the attendees will learn about l JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and see how they can be used to properly secure single page applications.
