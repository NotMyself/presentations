# Add Auth0 to Vue.js

In this talk we will discuss the reason why we I've started to write about Auth0 in combination with Vue.js and why multiple articles in the past on how to use Vue.js with Auth0 were outdated or used JavaScript in a way we wouldnâ€™t. This will guide you through the setup with a fresh initialized Vue.js application and how to setup your own Authentication plugin for Vue using Auth0's Hosted Pages.
